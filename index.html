        <h1>Owls</h1>
        <p>
          Most birds of prey sport eyes on the sides of their heads,
          but the stereoscopic nature of the owl's forward-facing eyes permits the greater
          sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting.

        <P> "A wise old owl sat on an oak; The more he saw the less he spokes;
            The less he spoke the more he heard; Why aren't we like wise old birds?</P>
