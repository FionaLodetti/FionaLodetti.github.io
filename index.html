    <h1>My First Webpage</h1>

    <p>Hello World! Hello World!</p>


    <h1> Who am I ? </h1>

    <p>My name is Fiona</p>
<p> I'm 22 and I practice horse riding for more than 12 years. </p>
<p> I also practice horse riding in competition and more precisely in jumping and dressage.</p>
<p> I have 3 horses. One male, one female and one pony.</p>

 <h1> My horses </h1>

<p> I had my horses at different time of my life. The first one was Ténor, the second one was Kito and the last one was Constance.</p>

 <h2> Tenor Du Moncel </h2>
<p> My grandpa bought me Ténor when I was 16. 
  The riding club when I was this year receive 4 Trotteurs Français which are horses that are the best for horse-races,
   but they are not usual for jumping competitions because of their morphology.  </p>

<p> So, Tenor is a male. When I become his human he was 5yo. We make progress together.  </p>   
<p> When I ride him, at the beginning, he was totally afraid and scared because of his racing past where he was abused by his owners.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, this is a very bad world and horses are victims in this world.</p>
<p> When we became Tenor's owners, he was supposed to be killed to the slaughterhouse. </p>
<p> I ride him during 2 years. We made a lot a jumping competition. We made jumps higher than 1m35 together</p>
<p> One day, when he was 8, during a jumping show, we jump the obstacle n°4 and we felt. He just dislocate his kneecap. </p>
<p> I treat him with my vet and the osteopath but unfortunately, I never ride him again after this day.</p>
<p> He's now 13, he's at my home, in a 6-hectare meadow with a little friend and he enjoys his life. </p>
<p> He has never been so beautiful, so fit, in shape, with his mind at his best</p>
<p> Tenor is the nicest horse I have never meet. Even my mother loves him so much, and God know how much she's terrifyed by horses.</p>

 <h2> Kito d'Acqs </h2>
<p> Kito was given to me by my Saddle club when he was 18. He was used by the saddle club during 14 years old and in 2015 comes the time he has to retired. </p>
<p> As evrey saddle club, they give for free their poney that become too old to be used for the courses to peolple they trust to keep them until the end of their life</p>
<p> As I said previously, Tenor is now home with a little friend. It is Kito. I took him home when Ténor was injured </p>
<p> It is forbidden to let a horse alone in a meadow. They must be minimum 2 because they are animals that live in groups </p>
 
<p> They are now best friend. They spent all their time together and Kito has never been so happy. </p>
<p> He is also enjoying his retirement and he find a new lease of life </p>

<h2> Constance de Belair </h2>
<p> Constance is a 7yo female. She is a good horse. Her father has done the Olympic Games a few years ago. She has really good disposition for jumping shows.</p>
<p> I bought her with my safeties, after working several months. </p>
<p> She's obviously not the nicest horse I have ever met. She's very difficult to understand.</p>
<p> When she arrived in my saddle club, after I bought her, she was very dangerous with me. I had to be careful everytime.</p>
<p> Everyone told me that I had to sell her back because she will kill me.</p>
<p> I learn to know how she works and now everything is ok between us. But she only trust me and she is still bad with other people even my friends when I ask them to take care of her when I am not here</p>
